### What is IPFS?&#x20;

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing (CIDs) to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.

It enables the creation of completely distributed applications, and in doing so aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

### What is a CID on IPFS?&#x20;

A content identifier, or CID, is a cryptographic hash of the content that is used to indicate the digital file in IPFS. It does not indicate where the content is stored, but forms a kind of "address" based on the content itself. The CID is short, regardless of the size of its underlying content.
