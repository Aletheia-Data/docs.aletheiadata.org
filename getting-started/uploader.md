3\. **Enter** in the search bar **what you are looking for** and our **mini search engine** will display the _**best information**_ based on the data **available in the file**. In this example, we're **searching** for the key phrase "**Santo Domingo**" in the file.

This way you can inspect the information before downloading the file, avoiding unnecessary downloads or wasting your time downloading files that you won't use.
