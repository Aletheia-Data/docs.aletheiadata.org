# Rapid API

RapidAPI is an API Marketplace for developers to find, connect, and manage their API connections. Find the APIs that you need for your project, embed the API into your app, and track usage of all your APIs through a single dashboard. If you have an API you've created, use RapidAPI to make it available to over 1 million developers already utilizing APIs through RapidAPI.

### For Developers

By using RapidAPI, you can consume any API using a unified, REST format that is easy to understand and embed in your app. Moreover, you can view all of the APIs you are connected to using the dashboard, which monitors things like the number of API requests, latency, and error rates. For more on using APIs, check out [RapidAPI for Developers](https://rapidapi.com/developers) page.

### For API Providers

If you already have an API, we make it simple to distribute and monetize your API. Adding your API to RapidAPI's marketplace gets you instant exposure to our growing user base, a search-engine-optimized profile page for your API, as well as features like user management and billing services.
