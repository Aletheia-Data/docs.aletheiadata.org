# MiniSearch

We created a service that gives you access to the content of the **assets\*,** we call it **MiniSearch**.

It will allow users to **look inside the file itself** before downloading it. This is very useful to speed up research and data discovery.

1\. **Go to the asset\*** you're interested in

{% hint style="warning" %}
_\* we currently support .csv files_
{% endhint %}

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-04-08 at 12.32 1.png>)

2\. Click on **Mini Search** under **Connect**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Group 15 (1) (1).png>)

3\. **Enter** in the search bar **what you are looking for** and our **mini search engine** will display the _**best information**_ based on the data **available in the file**. In this example, we're **searching** for the key phrase "**Santo Domingo**" in the file.

**Disclaimer**

Some files exceeds the file size required for the MiniSearch service to function properly. If your query is too slow or gets a "501" error, please consider downloading the file and upload it manually to your system.

We're already working on this issue.
