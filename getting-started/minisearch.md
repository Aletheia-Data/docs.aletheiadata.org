# MiniSearch

Some **assets\*** are accessible directly in the dashboard using our **MiniSearch Service**.

This services will allow users to **check the content of the file** before downloading it. This is a very useful service that could speed up researcher's work as it gives users a quick look into the dataset.

1\. **Go to the asset** you're interested in

3\. **Enter** in the search bar **what you are looking for** and our **mini search engine** will display the _**best information**_ based on the data **available in the file**. In this example, we're **searching** for the key phrase "**Santo Domingo**" in the file.

This way you can inspect the information before downloading the file, avoiding unnecessary downloads or wasting your time downloading files that you won't use.
