# Bit.io

### The Fastest Way to Get a Database

In short, bit.io is the fastest and easiest way to set up a PostgreSQL database. You can load data to a PostgreSQL database by dragging and dropping files, entering a data file's URL, using the bit.io command line interface tool, sending data from R or Python applications or analyses, or any other Postgres or HTTP client. You can then work with the data via the in-browser SQL editor or any of your favorite data analysis tools: SQL clients, R, Python, Jupyter notebooks, the command line, and more. You can even visualize your data right in the browser.

Aletheia encourages users to utilize this technology to create common-goods databases and shared them to the community on our [discussion channel](https://github.com/Aletheia-Data/docs.aletheiadata.org/discussions/8).&#x20;
