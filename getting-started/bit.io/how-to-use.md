# How to use

Once you have an account, you can start uploading Aletheia's datasets to the service. Go to an available dataset and copy the download link. For example: [https://bafkreicfmvv72gwexkkmusdc6yxn6fo5sqqi7al2yfvc6eu6fjuln7l2nq.ipfs.dweb.link/](https://bafkreicfmvv72gwexkkmusdc6yxn6fo5sqqi7al2yfvc6eu6fjuln7l2nq.ipfs.dweb.link/)

Go back to Bit.io and upload this dataset into the service. Click on "Upload data", paste the url we just copied and complete the DB information.

Just like that we have imported a dataset into our custom cloud DB. Once finished importing, you'll endup with a nice interface to query the data, add new datasets or manage the DB to accommodate custom implementations.

You can also utlize the full-potencial of Bit.io by Connecting directly to the DB. Just clic on "Connect" to see the connection information of your DB.
