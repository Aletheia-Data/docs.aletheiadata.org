# How to use

Once you have an account, you can search for a datasets on Aletheia:

1\. Go to an available dataset and copy the download link. For example: [https://bafkreicfmvv72gwexkkmusdc6yxn6fo5sqqi7al2yfvc6eu6fjuln7l2nq.ipfs.dweb.link/](https://bafkreicfmvv72gwexkkmusdc6yxn6fo5sqqi7al2yfvc6eu6fjuln7l2nq.ipfs.dweb.link/)

2\. Go back to Bit.io and upload this dataset into your Database: Click on "Upload data", paste the url we just copied from Aletheia and complete the table's information.

3\. Just like that we have imported a dataset into our custom cloud DB. Once finished importing, you'll endup with a nice interface to query and manage your datasets.

You can also utilise the full-potencial of Bit.io by Connecting directly to the DB to accommodate custom implementations. Just clic on "Connect" to see the connection information of your DB.
