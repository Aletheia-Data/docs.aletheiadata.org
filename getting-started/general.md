# General

This service uploads to IPFS any information given to it as dataset, making it "unstoppable" through blockchain technology.

All files will be distributed by IPFS (Interplanetary File System) making them uncensorable, immutable, and available at all times.

Once in the P2P network it will not be possible to cancel or remove the information from the network.

### What to do with this tool?&#x20;

Well, you can use our API to access to public information for different purpose: check what is being done with your taxes, or use the data for analytical or research purposes.

### Why use a decentralized solution?&#x20;

Using a decentralized platform gives us the guarantee that the information will not be modified, hacked, or corrupted. It also gives us the best option to keep this information safe and always available (24/7).

### What do you mean by making the information 'unstoppable'?&#x20;

Unstoppable or decentralized information means that the information is not located in a fixed location (or server) but is distributed in the IPFS P2P network. Once a file enters the system, it cannot be modified or canceled, since it will live in each of our computers.
