# Magic Connect

### Magic Connect

[**Magic Connect**](https://magic.link/docs/connect/overview) is a web-based authentication and wallet that does not require browser extensions, seed phrases, or downloads. Magic Connect solution comes with out-of-the-box functionality and range of Web3 features such as:

* Web2-friendly login methods such as passwordless email and Google One Tap that allows frictionless mainstream user onboarding to your dApp.
* Support for external wallets such as Metamask and WalletConnect so that you don’t have to spend time integrating with wallets.
* Transaction signing module
* Fiat on-ramp
* Send transaction module

Furthermore, with the soon-to-come premium feature, developers will be able to collect verified email addresses from 3rd party wallet users.

Magic Connect also lets users use the same wallet across dApps.

### Magic Auth

[**Magic Auth**](https://magic.link/docs/auth/overview) is a white-label solution that allows developers to build the look and feel of their app’s user authentication and wallet experience.

Additionally, Magic Auth wallets are scoped to individual dApps. In order for end-users to use their Magic Auth wallets on other dApps, end-users will need to export the private key and import them in a 3rd-party wallet.

### Security

Managing user identity and protecting the authentication and authorization processes are serious responsibilities. Mistakes can lead to unauthorized access and even financial loss from compromised user privacy or identity. Managing all of this, performing penetration tests and audits, and staying on top of the security trends are _huge_ endeavors and may require full-sized security teams to execute correctly. In the age of ever-increasing cybersecurity threats, most software companies do not want this high level of responsibility and liability.

Worldwide spending on cybersecurity is projected to reach $133.7 billion in 2022 \[[Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-08-15-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-information-security-spending-to-exceed-124-billion-in-2019)], and the average cost of a breach has skyrocketed to around $3.92 million as of 2019 \[[Security Intelligence](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/whats-new-in-the-2019-cost-of-a-data-breach-report/)]. Even though Equifax was breached in 2017, the company is still paying off the $4 billion damage in total.

Magic addresses many of these underlying security challenges in the world of identity and package them in an extremely accessible product for both developers and users.
